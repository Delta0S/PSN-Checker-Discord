**Important Information**

To install all the necessary packages, run the following command:
```
py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If this doesn't work, you can manually install the required packages:
```
pip install PSNAWP
pip install discord.py==2.3.2
```

Next, fill in the configuration details:
- **npsso**
- **Discord bot token**

If you encounter the error `ModelNotFoundError`, you may need to reinstall the `discord.py` package:
```
pip uninstall discord.py
pip install discord.py
```

Once everything is set up, you can run the bot with:
```
python main.py
```

You don't need to give me credit, but it would be appreciated. Just don't claim it as your own work.

Enjoy!
